## Overview: 
In this project you will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game! Using HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Javascript you will create a fully functioning game that will take user input, generate a computer choice and display the winner to the screen. You will have three class sessions to complete this project.

## Functionality:
* Must allow user to pick a choice (rock, paper, scissors). 
* Computer must randomly pick a choice (rock, paper, scissors).
* The computer will tell you whether the user or the computer wins the match.

## Project Submission:
* Project must have ALL changes pushed to GitHub.
* Project must be hosted on a gh-pages branch with a working url.
* Add links to working url and project source code to your portfolio with an image and short description of the project.

## Projects Extensions:
* Validate input so that it will return “Not valid input” if the user types in a wrong choice. 
* Will accept any form of a word regardless of capitalization (i.e. “Rock” “rock” roCk”)
* Will keep track of total wins and losses, until the page refreshes. 
* Create a game with more variety in throwing options. Example: [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)
